# To you, dear reader:
#
# If you are a normal user, we recommend not reading further. Its probably not
# the file your looking for.
#
# If you are looking at using this file as a base for your own work, please
# don't. It is a horrible example. Please look elsewhere.
#
# If you are a package maintainer, please read on. We recognize this spec file
# is blasphemous, a terrible abomination, a crime against nature, and more. We
# regret needing to produce it, but had to in order to attract enough users to
# find you. We beseech thee, kind and generous package maintainer, please help
# us mend our wicked ways by joining us and help us produce proper packaging.
# You are our only hope.
